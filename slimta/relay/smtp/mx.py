"""Implements an algorithm to query and pick an MX record to delivery a
message.  The MX record is calculated by pulling the domain-name from the
recipient's email address (or first recipient, if multiple) and querying DNS
for the domain MX email routing records. If multiple records exist, the pick is
made by using the number of delivery attempts to cycle through the options.
